Given a set of radar tracks $T$, our goal is to detect pairs of real-ghost targets $t_r, t_g \in T$ such that $t_g$ is a reflection of $t_r$. This work relies on the following assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The ego-vehicle is static, meaning the radar sensor does not move.
    \item There is a single dynamic object in the scene, specifically a pedestrian or a cyclist (vulnerable road user - VRU).
    \item There is a single significant reflector in the scene.
\end{itemize}
Once established, the suggested method may be generalized to more complex scenarios in future work.
